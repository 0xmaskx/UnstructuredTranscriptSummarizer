TRANSCRIPT:

we're no longer having the information that is for is in the forefront of what would benefit us so we would want an ai assistant that helps present this through all the paid advertised information and get down to the bottom line of what would benefit you what would be in your best interest and yes a framework like this uh would need to be open secure and decentralized and that's another thing that we are also working on is how to make this type of technology actually be secure ultimately we would need it to be something that is so secure that if you had a mic and a camera watching and listening to everything you didn't say it would never be capable of being used against you nor could any of that information fall in the wrong hands even your own uh we are currently figuring out a way to do this and the answer lies in cryptography and that is an entire other non-profit that we are actively working on on how to build a technology to ultimately deploy this in a way that would be that safe and secure and yet still open now i don't uh know how many of the people here i would love to hear your projects if you've come up with an idea for an ai assistant i would love to hear some of the thoughts or a piece of this that you've been working on dave was working on raven which his mission is to reduce suffering increase prosperity and increase understanding these are our ideals but we're right now just in the beginning phase of coming up with what would be the ideals of this ultimate personal assistant that is not bound by a company but is completely autonomous from anything else what would it be like having a ai that is autonomous right now we're going to use all the centralized means available to us to build it out so that we can understand how it would work what we wanted to accomplish and we will move it over to being completely decentralized at some point i would love uh one of the projects that is coming up that we're working on is a civil servant ai we would like to be able to have an ai just communicate with everybody within a community and get their thoughts and feelings and their hopes dreams and wishes for what they want done and accomplished usually this would just point them to resources but oftentimes action needs to be done we would like it to be able to collect notes on everyone's thoughts and feelings so that a comprehensive plan could be built out it would then re-collaborate with them in rounds of communication with everyone to ensure everyone's on board and that there is a consensus to this thing that these people have a vested interest in eventually we'd even want to make this so that we could take the informal logic of language and then move this to a formal logic which is a project we are also working on so that this can then be made into a comprehensive plan of execution for if you're building out a municipal for a local community how can you manage that community manage the funds manage the wants and desires with the funds of that community because oftentimes the most amount of work is just communication with everyone to be on board to build out those bylaws and the formal logic would make it so that there is no interpretation once it is written out and decided upon there is no going back and saying well it means this no it means that the formal logic would make it hard stated in a hard way that is non-debatable but we're getting the point now where ai can do the hiring the firing the management of everyone and this is where you're taking those 3 000 administrators that would have been needed just for a small community and now giving them the power of having a much better managed municipal that is a project at theocracy that we will be launching soon we would like to work with as many of you as possible in just building out a think tank for your open source projects uh like this one in this emerging field were working with people to collaborate on their projects uh hopefully we can build out a larger project as a whole as eventually all these little projects will probably be assembled into a very vision a grander vision but right now we're just in basic research all of us in this field we're figuring out how we can summarize how we could change how news is distributed we're just learning what are the possibilities and we'd love to collaborate and figure out some of that stuff some of the advantages of working with theocracy as a charitable non-profit are we can get grant research and grant writing done we can do fundraising along with other types of funding options for your project or just reach out to us to get started and help build out a team especially if it's just research related alone to yourself um we also promoting i'm getting a lot of thunder and lightning so if we drop out suddenly it's because the electricity suddenly cut out we also have just so many advantageous perks available to us to promote some ideas that you might already be working on for your open source project we get over a quarter million in ad grants so if it needs visibility to get more people involved with your project that is something that is there that we can help promote um if you're trying to build out a frozen language model and it's one of those open source models we can work with amazon to get tens of thousands of dollars to help train that it benefits amazon at the end of the day anyways because more people will launch that model so they have and they get tax deductibles for full tax deductibles for giving the organization that money um so uh we're looking forward to hearing from you and reaching out uh to us with cognitive ai labs discord uh just dm us for any business inquiries otherwise uh please uh type in the discord and thank you for giving us a listen all right um yeah thank you guys for um for sharing um i know that uh the the scale and scope of what you guys are working on goes well above and beyond what you've shared today um so i expect you'll probably come back and share a
