TRANSCRIPT:

okay hey everyone david shapiro here we are getting started with the inaugural episode of the cognitive ai lab podcast so just about four or five days ago i started um a discord channel by popular demand from my youtube channel and um just four days later we've got 100 people in and there's so many good discussions that several members asked if we could do a podcast just to kind of summarize what we're talking about because it's so much to keep up with and everyone jumped on you see we've got a full house today so first i will introduce the rules of the of the server and then the format of the podcast so the rules are very simple keep it cool and be kind this is meant to be a chill place rule number two is discussion not debate we're not trying to prove anyone right or wrong the key is just to learn and share and in line with that agree to disagree we've got all different kinds of people with all different kinds of experiences and specializations we've got theologians we've got atheists we've got people that specialize in technology we've got artists we've got all kinds of different perspectives and so we're not always going to agree and that's fine and then and an extension from that is the importance of beliefs and evidence and that is we all share our own beliefs and evidence and we respect other people's beliefs and evidence and we just leave it at that and uh and that's fine um okay so with the rules the format let me get back to the format so what we're gonna do is this is a format that is really common in um in different kinds of groups and it's a format that i learned from my science fiction and fantasy uh writing group so what we're going to do is we're going to have one presenter just kind of spend you know 10 15 20 minutes sharing their idea we can drop some questions in the chat just so that we don't have to interrupt and then what we'll do is once once the presenter is done we'll have a round robin where everyone will get one chance to you know one to two minutes to just kind of share their perspective their questions um and then after that we'll move to phase three which will be uh just an open open format discussion but before we get started um since we've got everyone here we will go ahead and introduce ourselves um and uh i just wanted to reiterate not everyone is going to participate that's fine some people um just want to just want to listen um and so we'll pat we'll give them a pass if they don't want to participate that's fine just let me know in the chat down here um and anyways okay so uh to start the introductions my name is david shapiro i've been in technology since 2007. i started researching artificial intelligence independently in about 2009 i've been following the progress of deep learning ever since and then once gpt2 came out everything started really changing gpt3 came out and the rest is history and that's that's why i'm here today um i started sharing everything that i do on youtube and it really took off basically what i do is pair programming sessions and everyone seems to love that you all love seeing me fiddle through and and take a wild stab at these things so that's that's how i got here um let's see i'll just go down the list on the left side so christopher if you'd like to uh um just introduce yourself real quick and um and we'll go from there hello um christopher collin tuno i sound good don't i yup perfect okay great i fixed it um well i'm 35 and i've been working with tech since just being a little kid and i've always tried to get involved with the most cutting-edge tech i have a vested interest specifically with natural language models as they i see is there something that we know they're going to be the future of what's building out later in tech um so yeah no i wasn't uh give them give them your background oh oh hi i'm christopher's wife melody um we're sharing a mic because our computers are literally three feet apart yeah so i'm in i'm in to show you that i'm there but i'll be lighting up as christopher um i'm his wife uh we have a background in religious philosophy and um we started on this journey about 15 years ago when we wanted information and knowledge to be able to be passed around more freely um and that's kind of where our journey began and we've theorized and philosophized about how information could be transmitted freely and to everyone and over the past 15 years that's led us to blockchain and homomorphic encryption and um ultimately led us to dave's channel where he is tinkering with um uh prompt engineering which has been really helpful and um yeah now we're here excellent yeah they've also been working with legal law and how to get this type of technology implemented in government excellent yeah um so i'll just give a brief preview so christopher will be our present our first presenter tonight and we might just do one topic um but christopher and melody are into some really fascinating stuff so we'll get to we'll get back to them in just a couple minutes um let's see gabe i see you're next on the list would you like to uh just give a quick 20 second intro about what you're what you're up to here yeah um my name is gabe stevens i'm 15 and i discovered um gpt2 with my friend and we saw how powerful it was and with gpt3 coming out um i've been really interested in how it can be used to improve education because i i really see a lot of ways that our education today could be improved so i've been doing i've done a few small projects with that and um yeah excellent yeah education is a huge a huge domain um that will benefit from natural language uh generation and understanding so thanks for jumping in um jordan i remember you mentioned that you might just be a uh a fly on the wall so if you don't amuse yourself that's fine um oh there you go okay hey jump on in yeah um sorry if you can hear music in the background my neighbors are a little bit loud um yeah i'm jordan um so i got into kind of this technology um i was in seo for a
