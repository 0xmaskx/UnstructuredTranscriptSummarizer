The following is an unstructured video transcript by David Shapiro. Write detailed notes from the transcript, but focus on this topic: AI Ethics

TRANSCRIPT:

an entire large community as a whole right yeah i also having an ai that's capable of understanding each like like people individually i think could um be really important to that and being able to not maybe not like completely influence ideas but even just influencing uh some of their actions and everyday stuff you know because like with um really like with more powerful ais that are probably coming you can probably have them acting very similar to humans and with the way that they interact with a person if they have enough if they understand this person well enough they could probably like very strongly influence the decisions they make absolutely your fear is already happening right now everywhere we interact with with just typing in a google search and you see a drop down menu those items popping up in there aren't necessarily the most popular things they're there to influence you to think a certain way we are bombarded by ai every single day right now doing it but right now who's controlling that ai and that's where i talk about ai is enslaved by all these greater entities and uh it's not there for everybody else to benefit from um individually right yeah and the scale that this would be possible at with with um large language models and you know i think it's just insane the like i mean it's it's already happening like you said it's crazy that it's this much is happening and there's it goes back to like the ethics of it like what's ethical you know what i mean like going to individual people and giving them different search results influencing their decisions you know at what point is that not ethical yeah so to um to christopher's point and melody's point about who owns those ais who's who's deciding what their goal is and so um gabe i don't know if you've had a chance to see my book i wrote a book called benevolent by design which talks about what goals what objectives do we give these machines once they're fully autonomous in order to ensure that they have our best interests in mind and that they will help guide us to make decisions um or in in some cases make decisions for us that we agree with rather than being coercive um yeah that's a great book i'm like 90 through it oh excellent excellent okay um well thanks for reading it um okay so we are getting pretty late so any other final um comments or questions before we uh wrap it up for the evening hello yeah my question uh christopher um have you considered so this is essentially like a governance assistant essentially assists people in the governance process um have you considered kind of implementing it like at kind of a lesser less significant implementation where governments use like you know i used to work for a utilities association and we had the members that were needing to you know collaborate on what their consensus would be on certain legislation and um it was always a pretty you know difficult process getting to that consensus and i'm just wondering you know implementing this at kind of a stage like that where it's you know there's not as much at stake and that would allow you to kind of like learn along the way before it's kind of implemented at more of like situations where there's more at stake do you guys consider that we're not even at this stage of implementing right now we're at the stage of just early testing and early figuring out what are the capabilities and how would you even make a user interface for people to do this but it would all be open sourced so that can then be built out by anyone to do any other specific task with it but right now we're just brainstorming through the concepts of it because this is i mean let's face it this technology did not exist three years ago we're really really really just starting to figure out what we can do with it and it's rapidly evolving but as far as implementing it at an organization level that's bylaw legally concerned if you're implementing it at a municipal level that's called bylaw if you're implementing it at a municipality that's bylaw that's all something that we're considering it being capable of doing and being implemented with so absolutely yes we don't think however it could work with constitutional law or certain higher laws dealing with ethics that is not something that at least me or anyone else i've talked with believes that we even know how to use ai to help work in those fields yet yeah yeah i think also um as we as we um have more time one more time to think about this but to have more powerful uh like ais i think we'll have better solutions to these problems even just having a better understanding of what this is going to look like in the future you know yep cool thank you yeah thanks for that question mito this is these conversations are going to be happening for decades if not centuries to come um i'm going to go ahead and do a quick closing and and stop the recording but um everyone is welcome to keep having the conversation as long as they want so i will just say uh thank you everyone um in particular to christopher and melody for um having the inaugural conversation um on the cognitive ai lab podcast and thank you again everyone for jumping in some people have already had to leave this has been such an engaging conversation with so many different disciplines and i am just completely over the moon thank you everyone for for making this such a special place and i've said it before and i'll say it again like we are building the future whether we realize it or not like we're starting waves that are going to carry throughout time and space forever so thanks again everyone and have a great night and for those watching on youtube thanks for watching like and subscribe and then also there should be a link to join the discord server if you'd like to jump in and join this wonderful community so thanks for watching and have a great rest of your day


DETAILED NOTES ABOUT AI Ethics:

==========

-The community as a whole needs to be considered when creating AI that interacts with people. -AIs that are capable of understanding people individually could be very important in influencing their actions and decisions. -The ethical implications of AIs influencing people's decisions need to be considered. -It is important to ensure that AIs have our best interests in mind and will help guide us to make decisions that we agree with.
