TRANSCRIPT:

little bit and i wanted to automate kind of some content production um but uh i wanted it to be quality and so i just ended up finding gpt3 and then um eventually i just it was just so restrictive um that i try to do kind of like um look for my own solutions and eventually like found gpg and um that kind of stuff and then uh that's how i got involved with the startup i'm a part of now um where we just host language models um and so um i'm i actually just started working for them uh so yeah that's kind of how it got into the space yeah yeah um and you found that that module was it fi ss or whatever earlier we'll i'll talk about that on the video soon yeah um cool stuff well thanks for sharing that and thanks for jumping in um keith you're up next if you'd like to jump in uh again completely optional um hi my name is keith i'm not sure how well you can hear me it's good i'm um good perfect um i really am brand new to all of us uh i've always had a kind of an interest in ai and computers and um and i don't know it sort of played around with the background or played in the background as i you know kind of delved into other things that will sort of live my life but uh when gpt 3 came out that's kind of when it caught my attention i uh have just kind of been studying studying it now and then really trying to uh uh perfect it learning prompting and everything to uh just to meet stuff with it open the future oh yeah well thanks for jumping in you always have the best comments on youtube um [Laughter] next up we got richard um corf i believe i apologize if i didn't say your name correctly um if you'd like to just kind of introduce yourself real quick 20 30 second elevator pitch sure my name is richard from baseball for 54 at the moment uh being in technology for a long time as well and always trying new stuff and uh creating interesting traffic excellent and you um just fyi your microphone is a little bit garbled so you might need to um jiggle that connection um before next time you speak um mido you're up next if you'd like to join in and also i apologize if i mispronounce your name let me know how to say it correctly no you you got it right david's meedo that's right thank you um so yeah so i just introduced myself a little bit ago but i can add to it um so specifically my good friend and i who we had built a company in the past a messaging app we're now looking kind of at gpt3 to kind of build a company around that specifically one of my prior clients is a law firm who had talked to me about creating a podcast before it was something that was just a little bit too onerous at the time but upon looking at gpt-3 i kind of saw that there was an opportunity to use this technology to essentially automate the production of podcasts for this law firm so we're working with them to create the first one and eventually i'd like to actually get further into their you know into the law process with them and see what areas we can help augment their capabilities with gpd3 gotcha okay so that that's why you're so interested in the automated podcast idea um all right i uh remind me don't let me forget to uh to pub to make that code public um i got started on it cool yeah yeah i appreciate that and we can actually thank mito for um for bringing up the idea of the podcast so um this was this was his his brainchild and here we are um two days later ready to go um so cool and uh i do uh i do hope you i do hope you start a patreon we have three people now asking for it so i'm waiting for a fourth person i can be the first person you should do it okay all right there we go there we go um and then melody you already introduced yourself unless there's anything you'd like to add feel free no i'm good okay um we got three more papa chuck roo and wobby i don't remember if y'all um you're welcome to jump in if you want but it's uh completely optional well i'm just engineer i i like nlp and i know you because like uh it compressed so much knowledge and because it basically is your [__] is a shortcut to cognition right so basically in robotics the thing i did during school and i like to do we have the problem you have the semantic islam of the environment but then i discovered that by the gpg can actually make a cooking architecture he asks itself what you're doing kind of figures out how to navigate the environment yes yeah the flexibility of these large language models is we're gonna we're gonna be spending years just understanding what gpt3 is capable of and by the time we're done with it gpt4 is going to be out and we're going to be lost again um yeah you're you're right on your spot on there um all right next up roo um if you'd like to uh jump in or if not we can you can just be a fly on the wall hi there can you hear me yep loud and clear hi um you might hear my son alfie who's two and uh currently grumpy uh yeah hi i'm rupert i'm 42 which is the meaning of life the universe and everything and uh i am a jack of all trades really i've traveled all around the world and done lots of different things and um i've really got into ai art and i'm also doing quite a lot of websites and blogs and things and i can really see the potential so i tend to work on my own so i can really see the potential to use ai to make it look like i'm a thousand people when it's still just some guy sitting in australia so right now i'm doing uh focusing mostly on art but i'm also working on trying to get some blog content for my uh different things like i do filming i do i've got my own toy company and i've got some econ companies as well wow yeah you definitely you definitely do have a lot a lot of uh i speak a lot i speak quite a few languages i speak i did japanese at uni and i used to be a french translator and uh i lived in dubai and learned arabic before i learned how to read arabic before i got there and quite a lot of other languages here there and everywhere it was very useful when filming around the world to be able to say at least


DETAILED NOTES ABOUT AI Ethics:

==========

-The potential for AI to be used for unethical purposes is a concern for many people involved in the field. -Some believe that AI can be used to automate content production, but that this could lead to lower quality content. -Others are working on ways to use AI to help law firms with tasks such as creating podcasts. -There is a need for more research into AI ethics in order to ensure that the technology is used responsibly.
