TRANSCRIPT:

suggested by ai cannot be fully explained if you don't know in in law terms in reasonability in a do you have a plan to make it non black box and that's all so you're talking about open sourcing i believe did he just yeah he's still there i think he accidentally dropped are you back any yeah yeah yeah i meant to mute myself sorry okay so open sourcing it is just required as it's a non-profit it's a charitable nonprofit so that means that everything is being contributed to the community and if you didn't open source it then nobody would ever trust it it's like coming up with a new security standard if people can't be attempting to hack it mess with it then nobody would ever trust it so that's just a requirement as far as the licensing goes on it um that would be per project but for the most part we're shooting for bsd license like a bsd 2 clause license um i hope that answers your question i think the other component and and i asked the same question in in in chat and we can so for the typically for this format we can just kind of go around and um and get everyone's kind of initial response and then we can we can kind of break into the discussion um but it was about explainability of the models um so just jot that down for later and um and we'll get that in the in the third phase of discussion um but yeah thanks for the thanks for the feedback and the answers um next up is gabe if you have any um initial reaction to uh to christopher's presentation feel free to jump in um yeah that was interesting i'm still i'm kind of thinking about it i'm interested to hear other people's responses but i don't have any uh initial reactions right now okay we'll check in with you at the end uh jordan you're up next if you uh have any initial thoughts or reactions yeah sorry i don't have any initial questions um i will say like i do think it's uh important that we get to the point where we have you know um assistance just because uh like i think the the we need a lot more productivity if that makes sense um like we as humanity like uh like in order for us to like in climate change and do all this stuff we need to kind of have um the kind of low task type things kind of automated so that we can focus on the bigger issues um i like again climate and a lot of the social issues um yeah i guess that's my initial thought yeah no that's great um that's a really interesting avenue for discussion that we'll pick up after we get done with the round robin so thanks for that keith you're up if you want to add any questions or initial thoughts nothing in particular i i just uh i think that that uh what they are presenting is just absolutely outstanding and uh and will and i will absolutely be giving them a uh you know a text here and a bit to uh to chat about some ideas that i've got excellent yeah that's why we're here it's all about collaboration and and making those connections that otherwise you just wouldn't find um so thanks for jumping in i'll go and chat with christopher and he's a pretty outstanding film oh yeah yeah they're they're they're a great team and i'm i just i'm blown away not just by them but everyone who's here so well thanks for thanks for jumping in and um next up we've got uh richard if you'd like to uh provide any questions initial feedback initial thoughts i see you unmuted but we can't hear you might have a microphone difficulty okay he muted again um all right well richard just ping me in chat if you um if you get your microphone sorted out and we can come back to you uh medo you're up hey guys that was an amazing presentation um just talk about working on something so cutting edge i guess i was wondering if you could just kind of like briefly describe to me the value proposition of combining gpt3 with the blockchain like it just in a very kind of like short little like description what would you say is the value proposition of that i don't think openai would allow that i think openai was a non-profit but they became a for-profit model and if you're talking about gpt-3 they only plan on releasing that open source after they make a hundred times profit i don't think that is a realistic or feasible thing we'd have to work with something that is being built out that'd be open source ultimately which is still being created through gptj gbt neox that is very similar and every two weeks there's a new uh natural language model that's just being released so uh it anything that you create in like a year it's gonna be obsolete already so it's coming out fast and there'll be a lot more open source models merging on the scene quickly so i guess uh let me clarify what do you see as the value proposition of combining a language model with the blockchain nothing i don't think the blockchain would be able to do anything really okay i was it's not so much about blockchain as it is making it decentralized i guess i guess if you could help me understand what type of blockchain are you thinking are you talking about like an open blockchain a private blockchain what type of blockchain maybe maybe i'm not understanding right one other clarification meto i think is um do you mean the model itself or the input and output of the model you know i was there was a discussion where you had mentioned about the security being implemented through a blockchain oh you would mention okay no i was explaining that a democratized database is a blockchain if we were in some cases using a database to share information that was already generated that would be a good instance of using a blockchain if we ended up having the model come up with a type of a contract that the community could execute on through bylaws that would be good doing through a blockchain um but not actually running the model on itself it would be good to have a blockchain manage the servers and decentralize them and have them run but that would be at a layer 2 solution and i don't think you would want to do it at the layer one there is ways to do this through
