TRANSCRIPT:

brains and training these little blobs of of brain matter to do little tricks and stuff but that begs the question how big does a brain have to be before it's actually sentient and capable of suffering right because if you take a few stem cells from a person and regress those stem cells into um into a brain and it and you grow it into a thumb sized brain and you train it to you know drive a little cart around and you zap it to you know inflict suffering until it learns how to drive the cart the way that you want to to me that's horrifying i think that like okay so and then the question is what's the difference between that little brain that you're zapping to get it to behave how you want and one of these large language models and until we can better articulate the difference like you know and this this was a discussion that was going on in the philosophy and ethics channel was if we believe that the world is just matter and energy so that's materialism then functionally it doesn't like a neural network is a neural network right there's organic neural networks and there's digital neural networks but if matter and energy is all that there is then there is nothing preventing a machine from becoming fully sentient now that's a i'm just operating from that that hypothetical space that's not necessarily what i believe but i also must concede that i don't know um so i'll just add in um that's kind of my take on like we do have to proceed carefully um so jordan i hope that answers kind of um your query yeah and i don't think there's gonna be like a definite answer i just found it interesting that we're kind of working towards this goal um at least i think a lot of the industry is but there haven't been really like that discussion i mean i think it's been around but not not as deeply as you would think that that makes sense right uh it's not really a discussion right now because the technology is not even believed to be existing in the foreseeable future right so we can only theorize like um but i will tell you in my opinion when we will no longer be able to tell the ai from a real person there's a certain so right now all the ai is frozen and think of it as just going through an a6 chip that the way everything's pre-ordained how it has to go through the model every single time and temperature is only about causing the lesser ordained actions to then follow through this language model what we're missing is we're missing ram we're missing a way of also then altering this model and having the model alter in real time there is ai that every time information goes through it the ai relearns every single time this would be like gbt relearning every single time something goes through it we've tried to run these models before for even the simplest tasks and boy oh boy does it take a lot of flops of power but they use this model in go in order to beat every other player because you can't predict everything go would ever happen in the game but when it could then learn the moves as the game was happening this is how it was able to beat every single human being once that's implemented in this natural language i highly doubt any of us would not know it from a real human being it would feel as real as any other person you've ever talked to and we're going to have a real serious issue at that point of morally how do we behave with this ai and that is coming but whether it's going to be a real person or not um yeah and the horsepower to do that i'll just tell you the chips out there right now in the next five years won't even be close to being able to run this yeah yeah it's a matter of scale um right now the scientific consensus and i think this is changing but um like in order to get erb approval to do science experiments on animals it's much easier to get um approval to experiment on invertebrates which includes like clams and bugs but also octopi and which are very intelligent than it is to get approval on vertebrates and so that's just another example of like okay they both have nervous systems and they both can experience suffering so what's the difference and our understanding of sentience and consciousness is evolving um so that just goes back to to christopher's point about um you know how much energy does it take what level of sophistication qualifies so on and so forth um melody says human bias i don't know if that was a response to what i was saying or in the chat um but yeah so we do have a few people dropping off and we're at the recording is an hour and 40 minutes so i think um i think it's time to start winding down if there's any closing comments um let's uh let's just do a quick round table and uh and just have any any final thoughts and then we'll call it and call it an evening can i do a comment yeah jump in all right so okay so let's talk about it getting smart and sentient and all that okay so what if you get smart right is smarter than you are and take decisions for you so what happens to your free will hmm christopher you want to jump in on that or you want me to i've actually been working on a sci-fi novel just about that for over a year now and how ai would affect our free choice our free will with the power of suggestions see i personally don't think of humans as that smart we are pretty stupid we only know something because we've been taught it if a human being hasn't even been taught the math scale we just can't conceive of much if ai could start injecting and implanting ideas into our head well it could retrain us and re uh remake us and this is a big fear of actually um everybody making ai right now is what would be a malicious way a government could use it to control the entire society this is one of the reasons why i founded deocracy because i think that that power being in any one person's hands is any one government any one company is too much to decentralize that power of how this would happen because when we start to put the weights and the biases in there it needs to be as
