TRANSCRIPT:

little bit more um if you'll have us yeah yeah so far so good i'm i'm i'd love go ahead i'd love to share with you about d bios foundation which is the other foundation where we're working with um fhe that's called fully homogeneous technology that's fully homomorphic encryption and what that is is is ciphertext is the text where you encrypt something and that is your encrypted data there is now a way to do computation inside ciphertext we think that this is going to blow up the world wide web in ways that we just can't even imagine when somewhat homomorphic encryption came out that enabled um uh the world wide web the world wide web for us doing secure connections through https ssh that's somewhat homomorphic encryption we're about to move to fully homomorphic encryption in this upcoming year and we already are beginning to make that move that's going to change everything for technology just like we could all suddenly talk to a bank and now make a secure transaction when the worldwide ed first came out we couldn't do that but once uh we could make secure connections to servers then everything exploded and fhe is going to really blow it up and that's something that we're working on with another foundation yup excellent yeah um all right well so with the uh the conclusion of the presentation bit um we'll start with the round robin uh uh portion and i'll go ahead and get started just in case anyone's not familiar with uh with this process um so basically i'm just going to take a minute or two just to kind of share my thoughts and ideas and reactions um to the presentation um and so as uh as christopher mentioned um you know one of my projects is an artificial cognitive entity or raven as i as i dubbed it um and the the idea that that i created and i think this is what actually brought christopher and melody um uh to us was the idea that um that we could have an information concierge that would be like that kind of lifelong companion and of course we've seen this in fiction right if you've played the game halo right you you have this narrative companion called cortana which microsoft then you know commercialized and you've seen this again and again one of the more recent one iterations of this idea of an ai companion was in one of my favorite games of all time mass effect andromeda where you've got this like sarcastic um dry uh artificial intelligence that's in your head and he's like giving you advice and and kind of guiding you through the story and it's like i've always wondered like wouldn't it be great if we could have that in real life where you just like man why am i so tired today and your ai is like oh well you only got three hours of sleep last night maybe you should like take a nap or if you um you know or like what should i eat today and it's like well you haven't had enough vegetables maybe eat some vegetables and that's like you know mundane stuff but then there's more complicated things like how do i get a job or how do i buy a house right these complicated things that if you just had an anthropomorphic interface that you could just talk to and it's something that knows you it gets to know you and knows what you need and develops that relationship over time that would be great and so that's what i you know i've been working on the cognitive architecture part but then along comes christopher and melody and they're like oh we've got we've got the governance and security part um i guess not all figured out but they're certainly miles ahead of where i was and i was because in my mind i was just like oh you know maybe a private blockchain is all we need so that you know your data for your version for your instance of your chat bot is secure but they're like no that's not going to be good enough so i'll look forward to hearing having them come back and share that their perspective on how to make sure that you know the future of you know world wide web 3.0 or whatever you know is going to be secure okay so that's my initial feedback um we'll just go down the list i see any here um you jumped in right at the end of the introductions so if you'd like to uh just give a quick 20 or 30 second you know introduction to yourself and then one to two minutes response to uh christopher's presentation um jump right on in and then we'll we'll move right along yeah sure and i'm a lawyer i graduated from law school during the pandemic and i got a i did a post-grad study in artificial intelligence and law during this postgrad study i applied to the gpt3 beta i got in and first i thought it was a great idea to use for um stopping the spread of this information that was going on at the moment because the uncertainty of the covet virus but then i realized that i needed a it wasn't just easy as identifying sentiments etc there was a great article about this called like how can gp3 even the most advanced models don't recognize for example a phrase was like i love my immigrants three dips under unlike that got a positive review from the language models but it's not the case so then went from that idea to education without biases um and started a using a prompt just from designing and making a lot lots of experimentations with davinci 0.1 and the problem i had at that at that time was that um the davinci models made stuff up like being a parent or or something that didn't go well according to the instruction uh that was the mo the motif of my final post-grad study and now here i am learning about fine-tuning about um creating chatbots etc and what i found interesting about christopher's recent chat was like how like according to our new new regulations that the gdpr in europe released and all companies have to abide for it like usually companies um work around the the strict country and then do the global one um and i would like to ask christopher like how can because there's the the thing of explainability about the model you're trying to build and you don't know the black box behind for example a policy
