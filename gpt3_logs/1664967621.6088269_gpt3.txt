TRANSCRIPT:

something in their language so like nina where's it is uh hello can i take your picture in swahili which was quite useful in kenya and has not been useful since right oh hey you know when you need it you need it um yeah yeah that's fantastic and um and i'm really impressed with the with the art that you've shared on on the on the server so please keep it up and thanks for jumping in as well um i'm i'm i just love the different perspectives that we get um okay last year oh sorry go ahead i was just saying it's such a wonderful mix of people and i feel like the dumb guy in the room which is lovely okay the the polly the globetrotting polyglot is not the dumb guy i promise no i i know i know that feeling though okay so last up for introductions we've got wobby if you'd like to uh jump in i know you're into some really interesting stuff oh yeah well that's flattering thanks david uh i uh yeah uh you can call me wobby i uh i'm from ontario canada uh i've pretty much started learning uh programming because i was making uh like language learning tools um in excel and uh and was finding that i was running into a lot of issues with it and so coding which i always thought looked really boring once i kind of got my hands on it it was you know game changing so i i guess i've been spending last few years like working on uh on my skills to to someday come back to um the language tools and uh you know it's probably going to be one of my side projects here in the meantime but um i have used gpt3 to um analyze transcriptions from um like uh focus group meetings um we're doing swot analysis on certain certain topics right so basically i just take the transcripts and if i needed to i checked them up but oftentimes i found i didn't need to and it would just basically prompt it into going okay give me the the strengths that were talked about give me the weaknesses and then effectively you just need to go side by side and look through it and go okay did we actually cover everything that we needed to and then input whatever you you know whatever it missed or uh you know remove something redundant or whatever right like but uh just because there was just so much data that we had to work with uh with this project so yeah at least for me it's probably it's not really that much i'm sure for like other people but uh like i said i'm a i'm like i'm a i'm a noob i'm i'm a self-taught programmer so hey that's where that's where a lot of us started and um you know what what you'll find is once you can automate something to do it 10 times or a hundred times it's a tiny step to do it a million times um so you're you you'll you'll be surprised how fast it ramps up um okay i think that's everyone um christopher are you ready to uh to present your topic for the night always ready all right um well i will go ahead and mute myself and um i see everyone else is muted so we'll give you um there's it's no hard limit just you know 15 20 30 minutes however long you need and then for everyone else if you have any questions um either jot them down or drop them in the chat so that we'll remember them for later but otherwise uh christopher the the floor is yours yeah we'll find out how well i gauge this audience and being the first one up uh we'll see how this goes this will be fun so as a married couple uh my wife and i do everything together we code we write grants thesis research papers trade in the market so if you try to reach out to one of us you'll always get both of us as we always complete each other's thoughts we started an institute diocracy which is a 501c3 charitable non-profit this gives it a lot of advantages which we'll unpack later theocracy is interested in nlp because it is one of several technologies that are promising to open the doors to democratize more sectors democratizing and decentralizing are in fact the same thing think of it this way a distributed ledger or blockchain is just simply a democratized database with voting and all those kinds of things in government such as the eu or the u.s decentralizing is the process of delegating responsibility of authority to local branches states counties cities municipals they do this because decentralizing authority usually takes administration and makes it just more efficient as a whole democracies are actively searching for ways to democratize more aspects of their government this is uh where we're at a crossroad where we hear a lot of complaints coming up about democracies these days and i usually find it's not the complaint about the democracy itself it's about that we have not democratized enough yeah like we don't have how our information is being governed democratized the municipals are not being democratized and we want more democracy is typically a big complaint we're hearing these days this is something that democracy is working to bring out and democratize realistically more sectors one of the projects that we're working on is an ai assistant now just anybody's worked in nlp has probably dreamed of an al uh an ai assistant something that would be a companion maybe a patron to you that would oversee your life a tool for daily tasks family friend maybe it would contribute to marital counseling or just be someone you can confide in yep a financial planner possibly even executing where your money would be invested into moving it for you and addressing these type of concerns a guide to information there's just so much information out there and man with information increasing at the rate it is i knew more as a child than i do now because the information is growing faster than i can learn it and i feel like i'm getting dumber every day with the amount of information that's growing everyone's in this uh situation and just having an ai guide you instead of using a google search where it is people that are have a vested interest in what they're presenting you not in what you need to know but that they want you to know is already painful enough in this information age


DETAILED NOTES ABOUT AI Ethics:

==========

-AIs could be used to democratize more sectors -AIs could be used as financial planners or counselors -AIs could be used as guides to help people navigate the increasing amount of information
