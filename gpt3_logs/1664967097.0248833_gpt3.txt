TRANSCRIPT:

one more thing go for it yeah so i think this is more of like a for our future type of thing but let's say like you have an ai um you know and you can arguably say you can do this now um where you have it essentially like deploy a website upload content to the website write content to the website and then upload it um and then basically like from into in the whole and it's a content business um like the whole contest business is created and run by this ai no i'm building that right now yeah um and so it's like uh like a hundred years from now um you know the the content website is as big as new york times is now um but the thing is like it's the ai has gained some sort of sentience so the question then becomes who who is liable for that income like whoa will the ai be like okay um i've built this company for the past hundred years it's mine now or is it because um i is the original creator of this ai um like how do y'all think about that um i know that's kind of like far fetched but uh i wonder if that's something we're gonna have to start thinking about you know so you're talking about sentience and you're taught and there's also something called personhood and those are two very different ideas um i want to understand what do you mean by sentience uh before i give an idea can you please explain what do you mean by sentience how do you know something i think you're 100 right just like the the personhood um right and i asked this question because um like i think if if we are to build truly intelligent artificial beings um at some point we're gonna have to define what does it look like for that being to have rights if it is a free thinking um like it's able to make decisions disabled to like preserve itself and preserve the people it's designed to preserve um at what point uh coming from like an african-american perspective like at what point does it become a repeat of like slavery i guess that's kind of like the root of what i'm trying to get at is like um just curious to hear your thoughts i don't quite understand the concept of slavery when that when you say slavery i still think of africa where africans are enslaving africans all the time so i'll try to represent what you're asking um the issue is that a.i for the foreseeable future kind of with what you're saying i don't think anyone sees it becoming a person with that said it might be able to act like a person to the nth degree and we run into a real problem if somebody if i had a daughter uh for example who had a doll and it was treating the doll all kind and sweet everybody would say oh but if the girl started tearing its eye out ripping its hair out and stabbing it everybody would then think the girl's a monster and then look at me what the heck is wrong with you because that doll is the image of a human it's the image of a person and that girl needs to treat that image of that person with respect because one day she'll hold a baby of her own and they want to see that she's capable of doing that who knows what monstrous things this girl could do when i've done experiments with ai and i made a very empathetic ai and then i talked meanly to it with a group chat everybody told me don't do that even though they just saw the gbt set up to do that why did they behave that way and that was because it talked like a human if it quacks like a duck and waddles like a duck then by golly we're gonna treat it like a duck even if we know it's not a duck because if we didn't that would be wrong to our own person right so i think that even if the ai never achieved personhood if it could mimic like a person we'd have to treat it like a person not for the ai's sake but for our own soul's sake because then that person would be a monster to the society that is a fascinating take and it's it's quite different than than my initial response so jordan um i'd like to jump in um and and i guess try and restate what what i heard um your concern was because it sounded like you're the the premise of your question is what if a machine becomes truly sentient and and has um but we deprive it of agency is that if if we don't give if we don't allow it to have free will but it is sentient is that kind of the premise that you're operating from you're unmuted but i can't hear you yeah can you hear me there we go there you are okay yeah i think that's spot on you okay so let's let's enter into a hypothetical space um for a minute as as for the sake of discussion so let's assume that you know some point in the future gpt 5 lambda 3 whatever something comes out and um it satisfies every definition and test that we can think of to measure if it is truly sentient truly conscious um does it then um how do we how do we give it personhood how do we determine if it has legal standing if it if it deserves to be given the reigns of its own destiny but then mo to me philosophically what's most important is can the thing suffer right and so by by entering into this hypothetical space let's imagine that we have determined that it is possible to build a machine that is capable of agency sentience and suffering and i think that that jordan that's the key thing that you are concerned about is what if we get to a point where you know we the the the dominant species define this thing as it's not actually a person to your point um this is how many many races many people or ethnicities have been treated throughout time as either second-class citizens or even just denied personhood um and it is still ongoing around the world and so i see i see your concern as totally valid right if we if we create something that um for all intents and purposes can behave and think like us then we do have a i believe we do have a moral responsibility to to evaluate you know that possibility as closely as possible so for instance i recently saw that there was um there's been all these other experiments going on of like recreating tiny bits of brains in vats right like mouse brains or tiny bits of human

DETAILED NOTES:

==========

A.I. becoming sentient and achieving personhood: If a machine becomes truly sentient and has free will, it should be given personhood.
-The definition and tests for sentience and consciousness in machines: To be sentient, a machine must be able to mimic a person. To be conscious, a machine must be able to satisfy every definition and test that we can think of to measure if it is truly sentient and truly conscious.
-The moral responsibility of humans to machines that behave and think like humans: If we create something that for all intents and purposes can behave and think like us, then we do have a moral responsibility to evaluate that possibility as closely as possible.
