TRANSCRIPT:

homomorphic encryption but then that's not blockchain and it doesn't require it uh this is for security what this is for security that's the reason you would do that for privacy well it's not just that it's that uh a blockchain is just so inefficient when you it's like a direct democracy if everybody had to vote in a community and a thousand people had to vote every single time to make every single decision nothing would ever get done bitcoin does what like 10 megabytes a second uh the entire blockchain that's just not enough throughput to do anything anything meaningful it's very secure but it's just not efficient so blockchain has this extreme limitation with scaling just like democracy you can't scale a direct democracy so you make a republic where everybody elects a representative and then they go out and represent you in the same way you would have to make a supernode that would then represent what is being done you would need and that's now going to a layer two solution not at the layer one so uh even ethereum doesn't do much until you really start to add layer two solutions to it in many cases otherwise you just make tokens but you don't do much with those tokens until you add on a side chain i see i see okay well i appreciate that thank you so much and very exciting stuff i look forward to following your progress cool excellent thanks for the uh the great question medo um i i foresee many more discussions um because this this platform that they're working on is expansive um okay next up papa chuck do you have any initial questions comments feedback might be on mute give them just a second to see if uh if there's any comments he might be afk all right rue or rupert hi there um yeah i'm just interested in uh the idea that most of my opinions are formed by watching bbc news and reading the guardian it'd be interesting to find a way to get opinions that aren't filtered through someone else's opinions um and that's the kind of feeling i get is uh my brother-in-law is uh is an ambassador and so is my sister so they all get their kind of opinions from politicians and things it would be interesting to get it from someone who doesn't really have any vested interest in any of it and so that's the kind of feeling i got was like imagine a sort of live newspaper of actual facts rather than facts interpreted by people uh that's the kind of feeling i got when you were talking and that sounds interesting and quite powerful to me excellent yeah that's um that that that control of information and that transparency is is is great did you have any um any follow-up questions or any um any observations i'm not at the moment i'm waiting for a train and it's going to be very very loud in just a second okay good could i give a response to uh kind of your whole thought to that go for it yeah so in media we have a a democracy oftentimes they bombard so much information that it kind of overwhelms you and you don't know clearly what to think about i i talk to a lot of people about this with they they get very upset about the presidential election but then i ask them what are the authorities of a president and oftentimes people don't even know this is one of the ways that democracies create order by making a left and a right it's been around for about 500 years now in addition to just bombarding you with so much information and your problem with media comes into that the way we do media is we have the mass media it goes through a two-step flow and then we have these opinion leaders which then people follow those opinion leaders sometimes what we see is we see so many opinion leaders that you don't even know who to select and it just absolutely flattens you of who do i go with so that is something that we are wanting to come out with a project imminently with deoccracy that where we would have something grab a ton of the mass media and then and then filter that information but the problem that becomes in this is why is something important to you is it if all you're told is celebrities is this important there is the president had an affair this senator did blah blah blah the income a lot of emotional fluff so the first thing we would need to do is get rid of all emotional fluff and then just give one sentence facts then it would need to get tailored to what does that individual care about most and that is a project that we are wanting to come out with by the end of the month and get started on excellent if i could have a kardashian filter on my thing so it just stops sending me all this completely pointless rubbish i'd love it but it will continue to do so for now also i just want to say i heard cardassian filter and so that that makes much more sense that's so good that's also excellent thank you for uh thank you for that that excellent question and and and feedback uh rupert and christopher um i think we got two more people for the round-robin session we got wobby and then andy you managed to jump in but wobby you're up first if you'd like to uh offer some thoughts and feedback uh yeah christopher and melanie excellent job um you very clearly have thought about uh oh you you very clearly scratched the surface right of uh of of the potential of of these large language models and stuff like that so um yeah pretty much everything everyone's covered anything that i would have brought up even even though i'm just excited to see what happens and how it turns out so thanks excellent thank you for jumping in um andy i think uh you you might have missed a good chunk of the presentation but you're welcome to jump in with any thoughts or questions that you might have i totally did sorry guys i was not able to figure out how to undefine myself like a total noob but i did figure it out you know after about an hour but um but um yeah well i'll just pick up on a quick thread i actually had a small project that i ran for a while called filter and it um it sent out uh news stories from different sides of the spectrum so i
